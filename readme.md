This is the official Foundry VTT module for the [Spells That Don't Suck](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-NR0OWlW60yv2EfA3qQp) project, by Omega Ankh and somanyrobots. It also includes a number of spells by KibblesTasty.

You can install the module through Foundry's package registry (Just open up Foundry, go to "Add Modules", and search for "Spells That Don't Suck"). Or you can install directly via the manifest link at https://github.com/somanyrobots/foundry-vtt-spells-that-dont-suck/releases/latest/download/module.json. (Note the manifest linked directly from the code repository won't work; there's some processing that happens to it during releases.)
